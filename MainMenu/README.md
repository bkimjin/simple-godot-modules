This package contains multiple UI node that simulates a game's main menu and options screen. Clicking on New Game will cause the game to crash as there is no `Scenes/MainScenes/game_scene.tscn`. However, clicking on "Options" will allow for simple key bindings, such as modifying the `UI_UP`, `UI_DOWN`, `UI_LEFT`, and `UI_RIGHT` inputs.

Tested in Godot v4.2.1.
