This package contains a Node2D object that has a collision shape and an image that can move around using keys specified in `player.gd`. The image references the default icon.svg that is part of every Godot project. This does not require the usage of InputMap in Project Settings, as the events (pressed keys) are associated to the actions within the gdscript.

Tested in Godot v4.2.1.
